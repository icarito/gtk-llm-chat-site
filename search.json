We aim to achieve this by:\n\nProviding an Intuitive Desktop Experience: Offering a native, user-friendly GTK4/Libadwaita interface that is both powerful and easy to navigate.\nEnsuring Convenience & Lightweight Performance: Creating a tool that is readily accessible (e.g., via tray applet), starts quickly, and operates efficiently without being a resource hog.\nPromoting Transparency & User Control: Building an application that behaves predictably, gives users control over their data and interactions, and clearly manages settings like API keys.\nSupporting Diverse LLM Access: Leveraging the flexibility of the python-llm library to provide access to a wide range of LLM providers and models.\nUpholding Libre Software Values: Developing Gtk-LLM-Chat as a fully open-source project under the GPLv3 license, ensuring freedom for users and fostering community collaboration.\nDeep Desktop Integration: Making AI a natural part of your desktop, not just another web tab, through features like multiple windows and system tray access."
