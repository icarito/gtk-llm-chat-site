# Development & Vision

::: { .alert .alert-success }

**Gtk-LLM-Chat** is a _graphical frontend_ for the command-line utility "[`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/). Just as `llm` integrates large language models into the command line interface, Gtk-LLM-Chat aims to bring that same power to the desktop environment.

Its goal is to provide **intuitive affordances** and seamless integration for using LLMs in everyday tasks — all while remaining convenient, lightweight, and transparent in its behavior.

:::

## Our Mission & Project Goals

Gtk-LLM-Chat is driven by a clear mission: to seamlessly integrate the power of Large Language Models into your daily desktop workflow. We aim to achieve this by:

* **Providing an Intuitive Desktop Experience:** Offering a native, user-friendly GTK4/Libadwaita interface that is both powerful and easy to navigate.
* **Ensuring Convenience & Lightweight Performance:** Creating a tool that is readily accessible (e.g., via tray applet), starts quickly, and operates efficiently without being a resource hog.
* **Promoting Transparency & User Control:** Building an application that behaves predictably, gives users control over their data and interactions, and clearly manages settings like API keys.
* **Supporting Diverse LLM Access:** Leveraging the flexibility of the `python-llm` library to provide access to a wide range of LLM providers and models.
* **Upholding Libre Software Values:** Developing Gtk-LLM-Chat as a fully open-source project under the GPLv3 license, ensuring freedom for users and fostering community collaboration.
* **Deep Desktop Integration:** Making AI a natural part of your desktop, not just another web tab, through features like multiple windows and system tray access.

## Roadmap & Future Vision

While Gtk-LLM-Chat is actively developed, we maintain a flexible approach to our roadmap, often driven by user feedback and emerging opportunities in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Our general direction includes:

* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly enhancing existing features, improving performance, and refining the user experience based on user input.
* **Expanding LLM Support:** Keeping pace with new models and providers as they become available through `python-llm` and exploring deeper integrations where beneficial.
* **Enhanced Customization:** Adding more options for users to tailor the application's behavior and appearance to their specific needs.
* **Exploring New Features:** Investigating potential new functionalities that align with our core goals, such as advanced conversation management tools, plugin systems, or further desktop environment integrations.

We believe in community-driven development. Your feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions are invaluable! Please feel free to:
