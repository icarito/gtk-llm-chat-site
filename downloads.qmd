# How to install

It's possible to install `gtk-llm-chat` in two ways: as a standalone application or as a plugin for the `llm` command-line utility.

## Distribution Packages

These are standalone application bundles for easy installation. These are recommended for most users, as they provide a simple way to get started without needing to set up the `llm` command-line utility.

You will need to allow the application to run in your system, as it is not signed by a recognized authority. This is normal for applications distributed outside of official app stores.

## Installing as a command line plugin for `llm`

`Gtk-LLM-Chat` can also be installed as a plugin for Simon Willison's `llm` command-line utility. This allows you to use it as a graphical frontend for your `llm` conversations. Use this if you'd like to integrate `gtk-llm-chat` with the `llm` ecosystem or if you prefer using command-line tools in combination with a GUI.

**1. Install `llm` (if you haven't already):**

It's recommended to install `llm` using `pipx` to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:
```bash
pipx install llm
```

**2. Install the `gtk-llm-chat` plugin:**

Once `llm` is installed, you can install `gtk-llm-chat` as a plugin:
```bash
llm install gtk-llm-chat
```

<i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill"></i>&nbsp; You will most likely need to install some [*dependencies*](https://github.com/icarito/gtk-llm-chat/?tab=readme-ov-file#system-requirements) for `gtk-llm-chat` to work properly in your system.
:::

**3. Run `gtk-llm-chat`:**

After installation, you can launch the GTK application using:
```bash
llm gtk-chat
````
Or, depending on your system and how plugins are registered with `llm`, you might also find `gtk-llm-chat` as a separate application.
